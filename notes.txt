Growing up with Nell: Narrative interfaces for Literacy

Key ideas:
 - Narrative
 - Growable
 - Direct interaction (tablet)

Narrative/goal based.  Need a path through the educational material;
kids are hardwired for plot as that path.

Tablet computing.  Develop motor skills.  Handwriting as UI.

Magic Book: handwriting as UI, book talks to you, becomes the story of
you.

Customization: rename the characters, make up new ones.

Modular: slot in new stories into the framework as you grow (serials),
write your own stories and share them with friends.
Stories == lesson plans.  "Teachers might feel more comfortable
substituting "lesson plan" for "story module" in the rest of the
paper."

Interaction design for *Children*:
 - handwriting recognition is not velocity based, does not depend on
   fluency.
 - children grow: growable design fundamental:
   - at first there are lots of things to touch
   - when you write letters you get told stories about the letters
   - later on you can interact with handwritten words, later stories.

Technology:
  - rule-based story modules, rete algorithm for efficient chaining
  - programmable conflict resolution.
     - show fragment for alphabet game?

  - AIML for simple interaction
    - cite stories about hours-long Eliza interactions (Radiolab)
    - aiml modules to give story-specific rules.
      show fragment for adventure game?

  - layered interface: nell avatar module on top on custom
    applications.  music maker, for example. balloon help.

  - Javascript/HTML5.  Heavy caching for offline use.  Turtles all the
    way down.  Integrated story and code development
    environments. ("growable")

Text is read aloud.  (Older kids can turn this off.)

Context: English literacy, or ESL literacy. (At least in initial
stages.)

Context: OLPC, Sugar.  Anecdote: lots of educational content, but no
way through.  Statistics show that certain applications are heavily
used *iff* there's a teacher who knows the application and can guide
the kid.  Goal: do better where there is no teacher.

Figures:
1) kids with XO-1? (in "personalization" section?)
2) photo of XO-3
3) one nicely drawn rendering of Nell book?
4) json story module fragment
5) aiml n/s/e/w fragment
6) turtle script fragment (corresponding to story module?)
