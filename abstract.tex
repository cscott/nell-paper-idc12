Nell is targeted at children far from educational infrastructure.

We present Project Nell, tablet software to teach reading and writing to
children far from educational infrastructure.  Nell is a modular
narrative system with ``a low floor and no ceilings'': the design
scales from teaching letter shapes to programming the system itself.

Nell is the successor to the Sugar educational software developed by
One Laptop per Child for their XO-1 laptop.  Nell targets the XO-3
tablet, a sub-\$100 solar-powered tablet for the developing world.
Experience with Sugar drove design choices for Nell.


\footnote Nell was inspired by the ``Young Ladies' Interactive
Primer'' in the Neal Stephenson novel, ``The Diamond Age''.  It takes
its name from novel's protagonist, but could also be read as an
acronym for ``Narrative Environment for Learning Learning'' (a nod to
Seymour Papert).
