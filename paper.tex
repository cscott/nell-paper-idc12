%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

Project Nell%
\footnote{We were inspired by the ``Young Lady's Illustrated
Primer'' in the Neal Stephenson novel \textit{The Diamond Age}.
Nell takes its name from that novel's protagonist, but could also be read as an
acronym for ``Narrative Environment for Learning Learning'' (a nod to
Seymour Papert).}
is tablet software to teach reading and writing to
children far from educational infrastructure.  Nell is a modular
narrative system with ``a low floor and no ceilings'': the design
scales from teaching letter shapes to programming the system itself.

Nell is the successor to the Sugar educational software developed by
One Laptop per Child for their XO-1 laptop.  Nell targets the XO-3
tablet, a sub-\$100 solar-powered tablet for the developing world.
Experience with Sugar drove design choices for Nell.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{paper}  % paper.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
%
% ACM needs 'a single self-contained file'!

\balancecolumns
% That's all folks!
